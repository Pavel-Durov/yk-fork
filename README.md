# The Yorick meta-tracer.

Yorick is a fork of the Rust language which aims to build a meta-tracing system
from Rust. Imagine PyPy, but where your interpreter is written in Rust instead
of RPython.

This repository houses the non-compiler components of the system.

The compiler repo can be found [here](https://github.com/softdevteam/ykrustc).
