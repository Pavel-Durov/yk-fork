# The Yorick meta-tracer.

Yorick is a fork of the Rust language which aims to build a meta-tracing system
from Rust. Imagine PyPy, but where your interpreter is written in Rust instead
of RPython.

This repository houses the non-compiler components of the system.

The compiler repo can be found [here](https://github.com/softdevteam/ykrustc).

## Getting Started

To get started, see
[this section in the documentation](https://softdevteam.github.io/ykdocs/dev/getting_started.html).

This repo uses xtask instead of regular cargo, so instead of running `cargo
<target>`, you will instead need to execute `cargo xtask <target>`.
