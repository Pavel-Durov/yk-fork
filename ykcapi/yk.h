// and run associated machine code. This is a C mirror of `ykrt::Location`.
//
// Each position in the end user's program that may be a control point (i.e.
// the possible start of a trace) must have an associated `Location`. The
// `Location` does not need to be at a stable address in memory and can be
// freely moved.
//
// Program positions that can't be control points don't need an associated
// `Location`. For interpreters that can't (or don't want) to be as selective,

// node to have its own `Location` (even for bytecodes or nodes that can't be
// control points).
