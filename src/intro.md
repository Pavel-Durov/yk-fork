# Introduction

Yorick is a fork of the Rust programming language which aims to build a
meta-tracing system using Rust as a meta-language. Imagine PyPy, but where your
interpreter is written in Rust instead of RPython.

Note that the system is in early stages of development: don't expect it to work
yet.

Yorick is developed by [The Software Development Team](https://soft-dev.org/)
at King's College London.
